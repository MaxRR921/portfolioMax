I'm currently working with a team of 4 other students at Chapman University
and a company called LayerJot, which makes AI-powered apps built for sterile processing technicians and hospitals. 
We are working to create a tool for hospitals to provide
suggestions to improve hand-washing practices in real time. We are still in the research stage.
