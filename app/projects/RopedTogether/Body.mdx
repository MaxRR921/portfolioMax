Roped Together is a 3D mountain climbing game I developed with two other people.
 It won the Judge's Choice award at Oregon 
Game Project Challenge 2022. I created the constraint based rope simulation system, the inventory system, which included shared inventories between two players 
as well as individual inventories, some 3D models using blender, lighting, lots of level design, composed the entire soundtrack and did all of the sound design.
