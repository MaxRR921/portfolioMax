Conducting research on the development of a more compact fiber optic stress sensor for high-precision, non-destructive analysis of
biological materials. Working under the guidance of Dr. Mark Harrison, this project aims to redesign the sensor using a photonic 
integrated circuit (PIC) and to develop custom software that enables real-time data collection and synchronization of 
devices. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use diagnostic tool capable of analyzing stress-strain curves, with potential 
applications in disease diagnostics and material replication.\
